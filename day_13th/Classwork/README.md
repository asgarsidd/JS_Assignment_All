Catch Me if You Can
This simple web page demonstrates a "Catch Me" div that changes its position when you hover over it. The functionality is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How It Works
HTML Structure:

The HTML file (index.html) contains a "Catch Me" div.
The div is styled with CSS to give it a fixed size, background color, and some basic formatting.
JavaScript Event Listener:

A JavaScript script within the HTML listens for the mouseover event on the "Catch Me" div.
Position Change:

When you hover your mouse over the div, the JavaScript code calculates the maximum X and Y coordinates within the viewport (the visible area of the webpage).
Random Positioning:

It generates random X and Y coordinates within the maximum boundaries.
It uses the transform CSS property to move the "Catch Me" div to the new random position.
Transition Effect:

A smooth transition effect is applied to the div's movement, creating a visually appealing experience.
How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the HTML file (index.html) and open it in your web browser.

Hover your mouse over the "Catch Me" div, and it will change its position to a random spot within the visible area of the webpage.

Enjoy catching the div as it moves around!

Happy catching!
